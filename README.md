## ‚úè  CRA Template

This is an app created using `create-react-app` that already has the basic, time-consuming setup tasks done, such as:

* ESLint setup and configured (to my liking)
* Other packages installed that I'll need 99% of the time:
  * `bootstrap` w/ `react-bootstrap`
  * `react-router-dom`
* Spaces converted to tabs
* Single quotes to double quotes
* `.editorconfig` added to fix Github's rendering of tabs
